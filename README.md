NUMB - (N)ucleotide Excision Repair and (U)V Signature (M)elanoma (B)iomarker 

A project exploring the relationship between UV signature mutation and the pathway which repairs it, nucleotide excision repair (NER), in relation to skin cutaneous melanoma patients.

R scripts in this project:

processData - Designed to unify data downloaded from cBioPortal for easy use throughout the rest of the project, deconvolute mutational signatures and append a UV signature to patient clinical annotations, as well as identify mutations and copy number variations present in each patient's NER pathway genes.
